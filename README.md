# Neo4j MCP Clients & Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. 

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any other MCP Client (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), to use natural language to accomplish things with Neo4j and your Aura account, e.g.:

* What is in this graph?
* Render a chart from the top products sold by frequency, total and average volume
* List my instances
* Create a new instance named mcp-test for Aura Professional with 4GB and Graph Data Science enabled
* Store the fact that I worked on the Neo4j MCP Servers today with Andreas and Oskar

## Servers

### `mcp-neo4j-cypher` - natural language to Cypher queries

[Details in Readme](./servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher/)

Get database schema for a configured database and execute generated read and write Cypher queries on that database.

### `mcp-neo4j-memory` - knowledge graph memory stored in Neo4j

[Details in Readme](./servers/mcp-neo4j-memory/)

Store and retrieve entities and relationships from your personal knowledge graph in a local or remote Neo4j instance.
Access that information over different sessions, conversations, clients.

### `mcp-neo4j-cloud-aura-api` - Neo4j Aura cloud service management API

[Details in Readme](./servers/mcp-neo4j-cloud-aura-api//)

Manage your [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io) instances directly from the comfort of your AI assistant chat.

Create and destroy instances, find instances by name, scale them up and down and enable features.

### `mcp-neo4j-data-modeling` - interactive graph data modeling and visualization

[Details in Readme](./servers/mcp-neo4j-data-modeling/)

Create, validate, and visualize Neo4j graph data models. Allows for model import/export from Arrows.app.

## Transport Modes

All servers support multiple transport modes:

- **STDIO** (default): Standard input/output for local tools and Claude Desktop integration
- **SSE**: Server-Sent Events for web-based deployments
- **HTTP**: Streamable HTTP for modern web deployments and microservices

### HTTP Transport Configuration

To run a server in HTTP mode, use the `--transport http` flag:

```bash
# Basic HTTP mode
mcp-neo4j-cypher --transport http

# Custom HTTP configuration
mcp-neo4j-cypher --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --path /api/mcp/
```

Environment variables are also supported:

```bash
export NEO4J_TRANSPORT=http
export NEO4J_MCP_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
export NEO4J_MCP_SERVER_PORT=8080
export NEO4J_MCP_SERVER_PATH=/api/mcp/
mcp-neo4j-cypher
```
