# Neo4j MCP Server

This is an extension that runs the Neo4j MCP server.

## Install

To get started run the command:

    gemini extensions install https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j.git

The servers require various environmental variables.  You can set those on the command line.

You can then run:

    gemini

Assuming everything went well, you should be able to view 4 Neo4j related tools.  You will need to set environmental variables to run them.

## Uninstall

To uninstall run:

    gemini extensions uninstall mcp-neo4j

## To do

Currently the mcp-neo4j-memory tools aren't coming up.  We're working to resolve this issue.
